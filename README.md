This program is an item manager for any items you wish to create, like in a video game.
When adding an item to your inventory, you can include its name, type of item, rarity (anywhere from common to unique, or any custom rarity you want!), and how much damage the item deals.
You can view your saved items, change up the attributes, or delete an item of your choosing using the menu. 
All of your items will be saved to a .csv file called "iteminventory.csv".
